   * \param uncertainties List of vector uncertainties (95% confidence interval). Each value should match an element in the values list
   * \throws std::invalid_argument if the input values list and uncertainties list have unequal sizes or a size of 0
   * 
   * \return An std::tuple where the first value is the resultant magnitude and the second value is that magnitudes uncertainty.
